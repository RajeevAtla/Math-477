There are $\pars{9-2}+1 = 8$ possible options for the first number, $2$ possible options for the second number, and $\pars{9-1}+1 = 9$ possible options for the third number.
Multiplying these, we have $8 \cdot 2 \cdot 9 = \boxed{144}$ total options.

If the first number is a $4$, then there is only 1 option for the first number.
The number of options for the second and third numbers do not change.
Therefore, there are $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 9 = \boxed{18}$ total options.

There are no repeats, so there are 5 choices for the first letter, 4 choices for the second letter, 3 choices for the third letter, 2 choices for the fourth letter, and 1 choice for the fifth letter.
In total, that means there are $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 5! = \boxed{120}$ different letter arrangements.

We note that the P and O each appear twice, and the R, S, and E each appear once.
We assign the doubly-appearing letters first, starting with the P's.
Of the seven letters in each arrangement, 2 must be occupied by P's, so there are
$\binom{7}{2}$ possible options for this.
There are $7-2=5$ letters left, so there must be $\binom{5}{2}$ options to choose where to put the O's.
There are then 3 letters left in the arrangement, so there are 3 options to choose where to put the R, 2 options to choose where to put the S, and 1 option to choose where to put the E.
Multiplying everything out,
\begin{align*}
  \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 &= 21 \cdot 10 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \\
                                                          &= \boxed{1260} \\
\end{align*}

If the relative order doesn't matter, then each book can be treated arbitrarily, regardless of its type.
There are 6 books in total, so there are $6! = \boxed{720}$ different ways to order the books.

Since there is only 1 chemistry book, and the 3 novels and 2 math books must be together, we can instead organize objects we define to be collections.
Let the first collection be the 1 chemistry book, let the second collection be the two math books, and let the third collection be the 3 novels.
We can then organize the collections, and there are no restrictions on the relative ordering of the collections.
There are 3 collections, so there must be $3! = \boxed{6}$ ways to arrange the collections.

Similar to the previous subproblem, the 3 novels can be treated as one collection.
Therefore, the total number of things we need to order is the 1 collection of novels, 2 math books, and 1 chemistry book, totalling 4. There must be $4! = \boxed{24}$ ways to arrange the collections.

We use the binomial theorem.
\begin{align*}
  3^n &= \pars{2 + 1}^n \\
      &= \sum \limits_{0}^{k} \binom{n}{k} \pars{2}^n \pars{1}^{n-k} \\
      &= \sum \limits_{0}^{k} \binom{n}{k} \pars{2}^n \\
\end{align*}

Here, we have used the fact that $1^x = 1$ for all natural $x$.

Using the fact that $1^{y} = 1$ for all natural $y$, we can write

\begin{align*}
  \sum \limits_{n=0}^{k} \binom{n}{k} x^k &= \sum \limits_{n=0}^{k} \binom{n}{k} x^k 1^{n-k} \\
                                          &= \boxed{\pars{x+1}^k} \\
\end{align*}

Here, we have used the binomial theorem.
